## How to get it works?
In order to use presented appraoch, user needs to follow the below steps:
1- Download Eclipce to your machine, can be found [here]
(https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
2- Download Epsilon to your machine, can be found [here]
(https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/download/).
3- Import Sync Engine package to your machine, can be found [here]
(https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/download/)
to the existing packages.

## Changing absolute path to make it works with your machine 
- Change the absolute path to works with your machince (Here I meant if they want to run the evaluation tests Generalisability, Correctness, and Scalabilty/Performance)


## Generalisability Experiment
- Runner class (as JUnit test) can be found [here](https://github.com/soha500/EglSyncNew/blob/master/org.eclipse.epsilon.egl.sync/src/org/eclipse/epsilon/egl/sync/SyncGenerelisabiltyTests.java).
- The models and generated text files can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hgi92cQ9tnab9J_0hz5j9IU2zkWjUZKw/view?usp=sharing).

## Correctness Experiment
- Runner class (as JUnit test) can be found [here](https://github.com/soha500/EglSyncNew/blob/master/org.eclipse.epsilon.egl.sync/src/org/eclipse/epsilon/egl/sync/SyncCorrectnessTests.java).
- The models and generated text files can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rrXCMSwvGpcH_buC9cMcLvmWREOoPdD7/view?usp=sharing).

## Performance/Scalability Experiment 
- Runner class (as JUnit tests) can be found [here](https://github.com/soha500/EglSyncNew/blob/master/org.eclipse.epsilon.egl.sync/src/org/eclipse/epsilon/egl/sync/SyncScalablityTests.java).
- The models and generated text files can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zWDiOvRI0FLbCsUXWfAQihWVovIU9P7J/view?usp=sharing).
- The raw results and the analysis in Excel can be found [here](https://github.com/soha500/EglSyncNew/blob/master/DataForScalabiltyPerformanceTests.xlsx).
